## Introduction
The Medical Software Applications repository aims to foster collaboration and innovation in the medical software domain. It provides a curated list of open-source applications that cover different aspects of healthcare, from clinical decision support to medical imaging and electronic health records.

## Applications
The repository includes a diverse range of medical software applications, such as:
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Systems
- Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)
- Medical Imaging and Visualization Tools
- Health Monitoring and Wearable Applications
- Telemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring Solutions
- Medical Research and Data Analysis Tools

Each application has its own directory, including a README.md file with a brief description, key features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Getting Started
If you are new to medical software applications, you can explore the "Getting Started" directory, which provides introductory applications and resources to help you understand the basics and get started with medical software development.

For each application, make sure to read the project-specific README.md file for detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Medical Software Applications repository are welcome! If you have developed a medical software application or know of an open-source project that is not included in the repository, please follow the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to contribute your application.
